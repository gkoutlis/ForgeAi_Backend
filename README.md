# 🚀 ForgeAI - The Brain Behind the Posts! 🧠

This Node.js/Express server was originally created with **strong help from an AI assistant (Gemini)**. I use this repo to:

- Understand how a minimal Express server works.
- Learn how to safely call the OpenAI API.
- Experiment with new routes and prompt strategies that I implement myself.

Over time, I'm refactoring and extending the code on my own, so this project reflects my real learning journey, not just AI-generated boilerplate.

## What's Inside this Brain? 🛠️

  - **Stealth Mode Engaged:** Keeps your OpenAI API Key safe and sound in a `.env` file – no peeking! 🤫
  - **Prompt Whisperer:** Our server knows *exactly* how to talk to the AI, acting as an expert LinkedIn copywriter to get you the best posts. ✍️
  - **Friendly Neighbor:** Plays nice with our front-end app thanks to a little help from `cors`. No awkward silences here! 😉

## Tech Goodies Used: ⚡

  - **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: The engine that makes it all run.
  - **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Our server's trusty framework.
  - **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)**: The magic wand for AI content.
  - **[cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)**: For smooth cross-origin chats.
  - **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**: Our secret keeper for API keys.

## Get This Brain Running! 🏃‍♂️

1.  **Grab the code:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)gkoutlis/forgeai-backend.git
    cd forgeai-backend
    ```
2.  **Install the gadgets:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Your secret key:** Create a `.env` file and pop in your OpenAI key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourSecretKeyGoesHere
    ```
4.  **Fire it up!**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    (It'll be chatting on `http://localhost:5000`!)
